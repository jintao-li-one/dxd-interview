# Iowa Liquor Sales Forecasting Exercise

We greatly value your time, so please focus on demonstrating your approach rather than perfecting the model.

## Task Overview

### 1. Baseline Sales Forecasting Model
- Use the [Iowa Liquor Sales dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/iowa-department-of-commerce/iowa-liquor-sales) to create a **baseline model** predicting total weekly liquor sales (SGD) in Iowa.
- Forecast **4 weeks ahead** for **ISO weeks CY2024 W10–W13**.  
  For example, at week 10, forecast weeks 11–14; at week 13, forecast weeks 14–17, and so on.
- For each week, you can use all available data **up to that week**—any model is fine.
- The goal is to **reproduce the weekly results**; model selection is **not the focus**.

### 2. MLOps Pipeline Deployment
- Build an MLOps pipeline to deploy your model with monitoring funcitonality.
- You may use any **cloud platform** or a local setup—choose whichever you are most comfortable with to minimize setup time.

## Requirements

Please keep the following in mind while working on this exercise:

- Document and explain any assumptions, decisions, or shortcuts you take (e.g., due to time constraints).
- You are free to choose your tools and format, but your documentation should clearly explain your process and reasoning.
- Use Python and any other tools you are comfortable with for data processing, modeling, and deployment.
- Share your code and documents with your interviewers using a version control system of your choice (GitHub etc.) and restrict public access.
